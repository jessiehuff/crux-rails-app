# Crux- a Rails app focused on making your company communication better.

Communication. Its importance can never really be overstated.

It always seems like a simple thing, but somehow it seems that every organization gets bogged down with overcomplicating communication. Many organizations get overwhelmed by email chains, extensive meetings, and misunderstood goals.

This is where Crux comes in. Crux is a project management application that streamlines your company’s communication onto one platform. It ensures that the entire team is on the same page about what projects you’re working on, what tasks need to be completed for each project, and allows team members to communicate about the projects without getting confused with email chains.

Everyone knows what’s going on and what they need to do. Simple. Finally.
