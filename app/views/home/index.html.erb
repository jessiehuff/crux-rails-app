<h1> Welcome to the Crux of your organization!</h1>
<br>
<h3> Communication. Its importance can never really be overstated.</h3>
<h3>It always seems like a simple thing, but somehow it seems that every organization gets bogged down with overcomplicating communication. </h3>
<h3> Many organizations get overwhelmed by email chains, extensive meetings, and misunderstood goals.</h3>
<br>
<h3>This is where Crux comes in.</h3>
<h3>Crux is a project management application that streamlines your company’s communication onto one platform.</h3>
<h3>It ensures that the entire team is on the same page about what projects you’re working on, what tasks need to be completed for each project, </h3>
<h3> and allows team members to communicate about the projects without getting confused with email chains.</h3>
<h3>Everyone knows what’s going on and what they need to do. Simple. Finally.</h3>
